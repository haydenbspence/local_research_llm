# Llama 400B Inference Server - 384GB - DDR5 RDIMM
[source](https://archive.is/zd160)

This hypothetical build by the HuggingFace engineer [Matthew Carrigan](https://github.com/rocketknight1) is designed to inference the LLaMA 400B model.
It has two variants, a single socket and dual socket. We outline the dual socket here.

## Performance Metrics

- **Type of Build**:  Inference Only
- **Highest Parameter Model & Quant**:   400B at Q6
- **Inference Tokens per Second (T/s)**:  1-2
- **Power Consumption**: ~400w

## Additional Comments

Matthew argues that to inference with VRAM on GPUS, the costs would be considerably higher than this machine. While the tokens per second are low, the low power consumption would be make it a potential good fit for anyone looking to do long running inference operations, for example to create synthetic datasets.
