# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
2. Provide reference sources as much as possible. Use https://archive.is to prevent links from becoming dead.
3. An exception to #2 is when a source is from an authoritative source. The source may use the same link to provide updates or redirect. 
4. Use BUILD_TEMPLATE.md if you are submitting a build.
5. Check your spelling and grammar.
