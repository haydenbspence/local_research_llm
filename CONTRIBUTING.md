# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
2. Provide reference sources as much as possible. In general, use https://archive.is to create a permanent link.
3. An exception to #2 is when a source is related to policy from an authoritative source, link directly instead of archiving.
4. Use BUILD_TEMPLATE.md if you are submitting.
5. Check your spelling and grammar.
